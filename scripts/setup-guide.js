🎉 REEL FRIENDS NATIVE APP SETUP COMPLETE!

Your web app has been converted to a native mobile app. Here's your simple next steps:

📥 STEP 1: DOWNLOAD YOUR PROJECT
   - Click the three dots (⋯) in the top right of v0
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract to your computer

🛠️ STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR PLATFORM
   For Android: You can build on Windows, Mac, or Linux
   For iOS: You MUST have a Mac computer

📱 STEP 3: GET HELP
   - All instructions are in your downloaded files
   - Look for the "app-store-guidelines.md" file
   - Consider hiring a developer for the final build steps

💡 ALTERNATIVE: HIRE A DEVELOPER
   If this feels overwhelming, you can:
   - Hire a mobile developer on Upwork or Fiverr
   - Give them your downloaded project files
   - They can build and publish your app for you

Your app is 100% ready - it just needs to be built outside of v0!
